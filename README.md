### ProductRecommendation.Console
The style of recommendation in this sample is based upon the co-purchase scenario or products frequently bought together which means it will recommend customers a set of products based upon their purchase order history.

The algorithm for this recommendation task is Matrix Factorization, which is a supervised machine learning algorithm performing collaborative filtering.

This works well when we just have a history without ratings etc.
